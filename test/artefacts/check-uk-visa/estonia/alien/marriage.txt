You’ll need a visa to come to the UK



^ You must apply for your visa from the country you’re currently living in. ^

Apply for a [Marriage Visitor visa](/marriage-visa) if you and your partner want to get married or enter into a civil partnership in the UK.

Apply for a [family of a settled person visa](/join-family-in-uk) if your partner is already in the UK and you plan to stay longer than 6 months.

^If you want to convert a civil partnership into a marriage, you'll need to apply for an [electronic visa waiver (EVW)](/get-electronic-visa-waiver) or a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor-visa).
