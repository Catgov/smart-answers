You’ll need a visa to come to the UK

Apply for a [Marriage Visitor visa](/marriage-visa) if you and your partner want to get married or enter into a civil partnership in the UK.

Apply for a [family of a settled person visa](/join-family-in-uk) if your partner is already in the UK and you plan to stay longer than 6 months.

###If you want to convert a civil partnership into a marriage

You won’t need a visa if your passport has a personal ID number on the biodata page.

However, you should bring the [same documents](/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) you’d need to apply for a Standard Visitor visa, to show officers at the UK border.

^If the bio data page in your passport doesn’t include a personal ID number, you must [apply for a Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor-visa).^
